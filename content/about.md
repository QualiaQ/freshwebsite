I am a postdoc and a memeber of [the situated cognition research group](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/philosophy/bewusstsein/team.html.en) at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum in Germany. My current research focuses on the psychology and epistemology of conspiracy theories and is realized under a Volkswagen Foundation grant entitled 'Why do people believe weird things: Bayesain brain, conspiracy theories, and epistemic vices' which I co-wrote with [Prof. Tobias Schlicht](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/philosophy/bewusstsein/schlicht.html.de).

My doctoral research was also conducted at the Ruhr-Universität and was supervised by Tobias Schlicht and [Daniel Dennett](https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/). In my dissertation I investigated the way in which the computational models developed within the framework of predictive processing constrain the space of possible mechanisms underlying perceptual experience and whether the framework can yield a new perspective on the nature of consciousness. I was awarded my PhD in Philosophy with a grade of summa cum laude in May 2019. My work was also distinguished by the GfD with [the annual prize for the best interdisciplinary dissertation](https://www.freunde-rub.de/nachrichten.html).

Apart from decision theoretic models of cognition, mental representations, and consciousness, I am also keenly interested in topics prominent in philosophy of perception, computation, meta-cognition, and philosophy of science. Outside of philosophy, I spend a lot of time reading about computational modeling, probability theory, and digital rights.
